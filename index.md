# womb.dev

an holy place

womb.dev is the personal domain of P. Edmon Graham, longtime developer and current digital product manager. Since 2017 I have worked at New Balance in Boston, USA for the Team Sports division first as a Technology and Development Lead, now as the Product Manager and Owner for Team Sports e-commerce on Salesforce Core Commerce. I have a passion for sustainable product and am an advocate for greater transparency and a move to a fully circular supply chain in apparel and footwear.

I am a pro wrestling enthusiast and trained in wrestling as well. I administer the wrestling-focused Mastodon instance [Bowldip Club](https://bowldip.club/@homosaur).
